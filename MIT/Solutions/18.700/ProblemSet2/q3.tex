\section*{Question 3}
\subsection*{Part a}
The only polynomial of degree at most 99 having 1000 zeros is $ f(x) = 0 $. Therefore the dimension of $ null(T) $ is 0.
\subsection*{Part b}
By the rank nullity theorem, $ dim(null(T)) + dim(range(T)) = dim(V) $ where $ V $ is the domain of the linear transformation $ T $. Therefore the dimension of $ range(T) $ is 100.
\subsection*{Part c}
The only polynomial of degree at most 99 having 500 zeros is $ f(x) = 0 $. But then $ f(2) = 0 \ne 1 $, therefore such a polynomial does not exist and $ (0,1,\cdots,0,1) \notin range(T) $.
