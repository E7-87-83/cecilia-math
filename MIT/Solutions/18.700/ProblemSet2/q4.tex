\section*{Question 4}
Since $ p_j(2) = 0 $, $ (x-2) $ is a factor of $ p_j $ for all $ j $. Consider the polynomials $ q_j = \frac{p_j}{x-2} $. These are $ m + 1 $ polynomials of degree at most $ m - 1 $, these must be linearly dependent because $ dim(p_{m-1}) = m $. So there exists a non-trivial linear combination $ \sum\limits_{i=0}^{m} c_i q_i = 0 $. Multiply by $ (x - 2) $, we have got a non-trivial linear combination $ \sum\limits_{i=0}^{m} c_i p_i = 0 $ so that these vectors are not linearly independent.
