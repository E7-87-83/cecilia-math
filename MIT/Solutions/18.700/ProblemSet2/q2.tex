\section*{Question 2}
\subsection*{Part a}
Using the same trick as in question 1, $ null(T) $ is isomorphic to the space of polynomials with real coefficients of degree at most $ 899 $, therefore the dimension of $ null(T) $ is 899. 

\subsection*{Part b}

Using the same trick as in question 1, $ range(T) $ is isomorphic to $ R^{100} $, therefore the dimension of $ range(T) $ is 100.
