\section*{Question 7}
As $ T $ is surjective, for any vector $ t $ in $ V $, there exists a vector $ v \in V $ such that $ T(v) = t $. Now $ v $ can be represented as a linear combination of the basis vector of $ V $ and $ T $ is linear, so we can apply $ T $ to both sides and so $ T(v_1) T(v_2) \cdots T(v_n) $ span $ W $.
