\section*{Question 3}
To start with, $ (0, 0) $ cannot be part of a basis, so we are left with 3 vectors.

Obviously, $ \{(1, 0), (0, 1)\} $ is a basis, so we know the dimension of the vector space is 2.

All $ \left( \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 2 \end{array} \right) $ subsets of vector is a basis, because of the following:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1
\end{array}
\right| &=& 1 \\
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 1 \\
  0 & 1
\end{array}
\right| &=& 1 \\
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & 1
\end{array}
\right| &=& 1
\end{eqnarray*}
As a reminder, if the determinant is non-zero, that means an inverse exists. That inverse can be used to construct linear combinations of the vectors so that they construct the standard basis. That's why the vectors span the whole space.
