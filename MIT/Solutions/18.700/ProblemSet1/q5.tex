\section*{Question 5}
I have spent some time (an hour maybe) trying to prove that $ U_1 = U_2 $, but turn out that is wasted effort because $ U_1 \ne U_2 $.

As a counter example, consider:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {$ U_1 $ to be the vector space spanned by the vectors $ \{ (1, 0) \} $.}
  \item {$ U_2 $ to be the vector space spanned by the vectors $ \{ (1, 1) \} $.}
  \item {$ W $ to be the vector space spanned by the vectors $ \{ (0, 1) \} $.}
  \item {$ V $ to be $ F^2 $.}
\end{enumerate}
