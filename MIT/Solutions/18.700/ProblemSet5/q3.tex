\section*{Question 3}
The idea is to construct a matrix that has determinant 0. For convenience, let's try to construct a 2 x 2 example. The simplest non-zero diagonal is simply this:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & * \\
* & 1
\end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

Now it is easy to see that we want the two unknown to have product 1, and that can be easily achieved with 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

This can be interpreted as a linear transformation that takes $ av_1 + bv_2 $ to $ (a+b)v_1 + (a+b)v_2 $, and it is obviously non-invertible because it is not injective that both $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $ maps to $ v_1 + v_2 $.
