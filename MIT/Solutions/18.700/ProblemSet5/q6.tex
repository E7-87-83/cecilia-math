\section*{Question 6}
We already knew that the rotate by 90 degree transformation in 2D does not have a real eigenvalue, can we do that same in $ R_4 $?

Why not? We can have this linear transformation $ T(a,b,c,d) = (-b,a,-d,c) $.

Here are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in $ C $:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  T(1,i,0,0) &=& (-i,1,0,0)  \\
             &=& -i(1,i,0,0) \\
  T(i,1,0,0) &=& (-1,i,0,0)  \\
             &=& i(i,1,0,0)  \\
  T(0,0,1,i) &=& (0,0,-i,1,) \\
             &=& -i(0,0,1,i) \\
  T(0,0,i,1) &=& (0,0,-1,i)  \\
             &=& i(0,0,i,1)
\end{eqnarray*}

Note that these eigenvectors are linearly independent, therefore $ i $ and $ -i $ are the only eigenvalues in $ C $, that means it doesn't have an eigenvalue in $ R $.
