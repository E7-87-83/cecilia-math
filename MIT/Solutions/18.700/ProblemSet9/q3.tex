\section*{Question 3}
This matrix has the required property:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    A = \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
      1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 3
    \end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
Obviously, 1, 2, 3 are the three distinct eigenvalues of it, and we cannot diagonalize it because the null space of $ A - I $ has only one dimension, therefore the dimension of the eigenspace is insufficient to form the basis.
