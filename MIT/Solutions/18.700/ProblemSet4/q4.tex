\section*{Question 4}
For any field $ F $, we have 1 and -1. (-1 is defined as the additive inverse of 1, which is usually not represented using the -1 symbol in finite fields).

Consider $ T(1,1) = (1,1) = 1(1,1) $ and $ T(1, -1) = (-1,1) = -1(1,-1) $. Therefore, 1 and -1 are the eigenvalues of $ T $.

Since $ T $ is a linear transformation from $ F^2 \to F^2 $, it has at most two eigenvalues, therefore $ \{1, -1\} $ are all the eigenvalues of $ T $.
