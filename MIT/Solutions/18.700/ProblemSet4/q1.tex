\section*{Question 1}
Since the subspaces are one to one mapped with the matrices in the row reduced echelon form, it is much easier to count those matrices.

The row reduced echelon form can be in one of the following 3 cases:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \left(1, x, y\right)
  \left(0, 1, x\right)
  \left(0, 0, 1\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

There are $ 9 \times 9 = 81 $ different matrices of the first form. $ 9 $ matrices of the second form and 1 matrix of the last form. There are $ 81 + 9 + 1 = 91 $ different row educed echelon matrices, and therefore there are 91 different subspace of 1 dimension.

To verify this is the right solution, I started learning \href{https://www.sagemath.org/}{Sage}. Here is some sage code that verify that there is indeed 91 subspaces. The code simply iterate through all possible vectors in $ F^3 $ and then canonicalize them using the echelon form and count how many distinct subspaces there are. Obviously, we must discount the $ \left(0, 0, 0\right) $ special case for safety sake.

\begin{verbatim}
Field = GF(9)
MatrixOnField = MatrixSpace(Field,1,3)
elements = []
for _,element in enumerate(Field):
  elements.append(element)
Subspaces = {}
for p in elements:
  for q in elements:
    for r in elements:
      Reduced = MatrixOnField([p,q,r]).echelon_form()
      if Reduced[0] != MatrixOnField([0,0,0])[0]:
        Subspaces[Reduced] = True
len(Subspaces)
\end{verbatim}
