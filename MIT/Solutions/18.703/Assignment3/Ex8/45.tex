\section*{Ex8 - 45}
A vertex of a cube is always connected to 3 other vertices. If we fix a vertex, we can choose any of the 3 other vertices to be the one at its left. That way we produces 3 configuration per vertex, a total of 24 configurations.

The rotation along the X, Y, Z axis for 90 degree generates 3 subgroups of order 4.

The rotation along the diagonal generates a subgroup of order 3. There are 4 such diagonals.
