Label the vertices as $ A, B, C, D $. Place the tetrahedron on a plane such the $ B,C,D $ is on the plane, by rotation, we can have three different rotation of the triangle. By reflection, we can have another 3.

Now repeat the experiment for choosing each of the $ A, B, C, D $ as the vertex that is not on the plane. This create 6 configurations for each choice, that is 24 configurations in total.

There are only 24 permutations in $ S_4 $, therefore the group of isometry for a tetrahedron is isomorphic to $ S_4 $.
