Let $ G $ be an infinite group, consider all the cyclic subgroup generated by each element of $ g $. Some of them could be the same group, so in general we may have either an infinite number of them or a finite number of them. Let's prove that it is impossible to have just a finite number of them.

Suppose the contrary that we only have a finite number of cyclic subgroups. We knew that the union of these cyclic subgroups is $ G $, so at least one of these cyclic subgroups $ H $, generated by $ h $ must be infinite. For each $ i \in \mathbb{N} $, $ h^i $ generates a unique subgroup of $ H $, now we still have an infinite number of cyclic subgroups, contradicting our assumption.

Since all infinite group has infinite number of subgroups. Therefore, if a group $ G $ has only a finite number of subgroups, it must be finite.
