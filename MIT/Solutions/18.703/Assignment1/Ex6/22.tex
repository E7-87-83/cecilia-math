\section*{Ex6 - 22}
Since $ \mathbb{Z}_{12} $ is cyclic (generated by 1), each factor $ n < 12 $ generates a cyclic subgroup that is not the same as $ G $. Now we can list all of them.

\begin{eqnarray*}
  G_1 &=& \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\} \\
  G_2 &=& \{0,2,4,6,8,10\} \\
  G_3 &=& \{0,3,6,9\} \\
  G_4 &=& \{0,4,8\} \\
  G_5 &=& \{0,6\} \\
  G_6 &=& \{0\}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{verbatim}
  digraph G {
    "G1" -> "G2"
    "G1" -> "G3"
    "G2" -> "G4"
    "G2" -> "G5"
    "G3" -> "G5"
    "G4" -> "G6"
    "G5" -> "G6"
  }  
\end{verbatim}
