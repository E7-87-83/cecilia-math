By the BÃ©zout's identity, we have $ 25 \times 5 - 30 \times 4 = 5 $, which means $ 5 $ is an element of the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in $ \mathbb{Z}_{30} $. Now all multiples of 5 are included in that group, and any element of that group must be a multiple of 5 because all linear combinations of $ 25 $ and $ 30 $ must be a multiple of 5. Now, we know that group has 6 elements: $ \{0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\} $.
