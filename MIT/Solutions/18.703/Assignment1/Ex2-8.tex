$ ab = ba $ for all $ a, b \in \mathbb{Q} $, therefore $ ab + 1 = ba + 1 $ and the operation is commutative.

For associativity, we have $ (a * b) * c = (ab + 1)c + 1 = abc + c + 1 $ and $ a * (b * c) = a(bc + 1) + 1 = abc + a + 1 $. So when $ a \ne c $, the two sides are not equal, and the operation is not associative.
