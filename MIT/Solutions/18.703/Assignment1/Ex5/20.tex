A group $ G_a $ can be a subgroup of another group $ G_b $ if and only if 
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item{$ G_a $ is a subset of $ G_b $, and}
    \item{$ G_a $ and $ G_b $ share the same group operation.}
\end{enumerate} 

First, consider addition, we have this chain.

\begin{eqnarray*}
    G_2 \subset G_8 \subset G_7 \subset G_1 \subset G_4
\end{eqnarray*}

For multiplication, we have two chains

\begin{eqnarray*}
    G_6 \subset G_5
\end{eqnarray*}

and also
\begin{eqnarray*}
    G_9 \subset G_3 \subset G_5
\end{eqnarray*}

The subset relation is reflexive, transistive, therefore the full set of subgroup relationship is the reflexive transitive closure of these subset relationships.
