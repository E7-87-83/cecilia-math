    \item{Ex 7: 1, 3, 5, 6}
    \item{Ex 8: 2, 8, 10, 17, 23, 26, 30}

Bonus problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Find all continuous isomorphisms: $ (R,+) --> (R_>0,x) $}
    \item{Classify upto an isomorphism, all groups order 1, 2, 3 and 4 the cyclic group usually denoted by $ C_n $ (or order n), show that for $ n \ge 1 $, there is a group of order n. Show that for $ n = 1, 2, 3 $ there are no other groups of order but for $ n = 4 $ there is just one non-ismorphic to $ C_4 $.}
    \item{Find an algorithm for determining the $ k $ of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, other than just checking all numbers between zero and the product of all $ m_i $ where i goes from $ 1 $ to $ n $.}
    \item{Show if two cycles intersect then they do not commute.}
    \item{Find the subgroup of $ S_4 $ which is the group of symmetries of the regular tetrahedron.}
\end{enumerate}
