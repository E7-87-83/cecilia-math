\section*{Problem 3}
The perimeter of the figure includes the two straight lines and the circular arc.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{The straight lines has a total length of $ 3 \times 2 = 6 $. }
    \item{The circular arc is $ \frac{50}{360} $ of the circle, so its length is $ \frac{50}{360} \times (2 \pi 3) = \frac{5\pi}{6} $. }
\end{enumerate}

Therefore the perimeter of the figure is $ 6 + \frac{5\pi}{6} \approx 8.62 \text{cm}$.
